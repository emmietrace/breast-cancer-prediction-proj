PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & SETUP
=========================================

1. Project Overview:
   This project deploys a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a breast tumor is Benign or Malignant. The model uses 5 key features: radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, concavity_mean, and smoothness_mean.

2. How to Run Locally:
   Step A: Clone the repository.
   Step B: Install dependencies:
           pip install -r requirements.txt
   Step C: Run the application:
           python app.py
   Step D: Open browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000

3. Deployment Details:
   - The app is deployed on Render.com using Gunicorn.
   - The model is loaded from the /model/ directory.
   - Static assets are served via Flask's 'static' folder.

4. Model Reproduction:
   - The training notebook is located in /model/model_building.ipynb.
   - It includes a robust data loading mechanism (Drive/Direct Upload) and utilizes a Scikit-Learn Pipeline for consistent preprocessing.
